Notes:
I found hardware hard to break down. Some things like the inserts were ordered in bulk, I took the bulk final total and divided to get my unit cost number. Example 3.34 including shipping for 100 grub screws = 0.04 unit. 

In some cases assortments were used. I used the assortment cost divided by the total number of screws which is not really accurate. If you need to build 10 of these at 1 screw each and the assortment has 9 screws you are going to need two assortments even if thats the only screw you needed 10 of. This could artificially inflate the cost of fasteners. 

You want a Tr8x2 because we want maximum rotations for minimum travel distance of the lead screw. If you get a T8x8 for example you will likely exceed the avaiable space in the shade while trying to roll it up.

^^^ Needs work, it should not be so many different pieces of hardware... I think we can reduct to just 
M2.5 - 'socket' head 5mm and M2.5 insert - 3.5mm O.D - 3mm

TODO: Make all hardware 2.5 with the same inserts and grub screws
